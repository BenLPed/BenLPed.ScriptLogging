# Description of the functionality provided by this module
Description = 'By starting a script using the start-log command, you tell where the log file should be located, what it should be called, 
and possibly whether it should delete old log files.`
Every time you have created some code that you thought should be logged, you use write-log together with the description you want. 
You can also add a fave code. 1 = Normal (1 is default), 2 = if the text should be yellow, to show something is not normal, 
but not an error. 3 = Error. It could e.g. is used in a try-catch, so when the catch comes into use, the error message will be 3 and thereby you know that it has failed.'
